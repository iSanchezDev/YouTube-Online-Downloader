# YouTube Downloader

Download video and audio from this web application.

Now you can get your downloads in your directory 'downloads' for later version tough I will let you downloads from you browser.

I just want to share without publicing anywhere to avoid copyright policy from youtube authors. So you could use it under your responsibility.

The back engine is based on youtube-dl, it is a program for Windows, Linux And Mac.
 
The JavaScript tool to communicate with youtube-dl is [node-youtube-dl](https://github.com/przemyslawpluta/node-youtube-dl).
